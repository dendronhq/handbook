### Daily Journal Note
This is how we do standups at Dendron

- [ ] Read over the sop (standard operating procedure) on [[handbook.sop.daily-journal]]
- [ ] Open your daily journal note for today. It should be in the format of `user.{{ALIAS}}.{{date}}`. Your manager should have created this one for you. You're responsible for maintaining your own journals for future dates. You can read more about the format [[here|schemas.user#dailyjournal]] 
   - NOTE: to create a daily journal, we recommend [[pinning|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.guides.tips#pinning-tabs]] your current daily journal and then using lookup to update the day component at the end of the day to create the daily journal for the next day

### Discord

- [ ] Register on Discord by following this [invitation link](https://discord.gg/xrKTUStHNZ). Read the next suggestions on how to choose a username first.
   - [ ] You can use your personal discord OR choose to create a new username using your Dendron email. It's generally helpful to choose a username to be the same as your Github handle, for consistency and ease of use.
- [ ] Make sure your Discord profile has a **photo** - it makes it easier for other team members to remember you!
- [ ] If you're new to Discord, a short primer can be found at [a Beginner's guide to Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord).
- [ ] Make sure you have access to the `#dendron-team` channel and post an intro.
   1. We love to hear more, such as where you were before, family/pets, and hobbies.
   1. We also enjoy pictures if you're willing to share. Consider giving your new team members a glimpse into your world (scroll through previous messages in the channel for inspiration).

### Initial Tasks

- [ ] Go to [[Job-specific tasks|templates.people.onboarding#job-specific-tasks]] for role specific tasks
- [ ] Go to your [[weekly journal|handbook.sop.weekly-journal]] at `user.{username}.weekly.{date}` to see your specific tasks

If at any point you find yourself stuck, don't hesitate to leave a question in the `#dendron-team` channel.
