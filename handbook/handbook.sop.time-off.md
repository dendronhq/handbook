## Summary

Taking time off from work is important to relax and recharge. This is the quick SOP for taking time off such as holidays and vacations.

## A Few things prior to taking time off

1. Notify teammates ahead of time.  A week ahead of time is preferable - if your vacation is longer, then an earlier heads up would be even better. Make a note of it in your task section of the weekly planning notes.
1. Make sure to do the following prior to your time off:
    - If your time off coincides with your on-call schedule, ask someone for a swap.
    - Handle meetings that you own during your time off - per your discretion, this can either be making them async, delegating ownership to someone else, or cancelling it.

_Note for public holidays_: since we're a global team, your teammates may be unaware of what public holidays your region observes - so follow the same notification procedure as with vacation days.
