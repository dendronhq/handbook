## Work

### Do I have to maintain certain hours?

A lot of companies that do remote work actually mean work anywhere but on east coast timezone. That's not the case at Dendron.

We practice **async work** which means that everyone works according to local hours regardless of where they are at.

### Do you have lots of meetings?

We have one 1h team sync every Tuesday at 14:00 UTC that we ask everytone to make it to (and even this is flexible since meetings are recorded on google doc).
We also spend 30min one on one with all team members on a weekly basis and accomodate local working times. 

### Are there any team events?

Dendron is all remote but we host many events to foster in-person connections, a few of which are listed below:

- virtual team lunch that switches off between Asia time and North America time 
- twice a month team game days on Fridays 
- the [Greenhouse Series](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/PqtlCsRPWBjKp3RR.html): a public learning series where team members are encouraged to share something they know with the rest of the Dendron community.
- [teatime](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/zOw3EfQ4czmTYG4mc3wnS.html): a voice channel for team members to jump and have ad hoc conversations with other team mates and the wider Dendron community

## Business

### How will you make money?

Our beachhead market is to replace confluence and be the default knowledge base for every technical organization in the world.
Our not-so-secret strategy to get there is by building a note taking tool that developers actually enjoy using.
Our users start using Dendron for personal notes and quickly end up also adopting Dendron for work. 

We get lots of requests from teams that love using Dendron for daily work but want more sophistication in terms of access control and synchronization.
They also want to be able to share notes with less technical team mates and make it possible for them to edit and comment.
Towards this end, we will be launching a managed service to help teams do all this and more in early Q1 of 2022 and it is here where we plan on monetizing.
