## Summary

The weekly journal is how we track tasks and priorities for individuals. It is also a good place to store tasks that are currently blocked or in the future.

We use the following template for weekly journals:

## Details

### Goals
These are the 2-3 big items that you want to accomplish this week 

### Ongoing Projects
Every team member is responsible for one or more projects that will span multiple weeks. Keep track of those projects (in order of priority) here so it's always top of mind. 

### Completed Projects
Once a project is completed (ðŸ¥³) move it down here to archive it. 

### Blocked
These are items that you are currently blocked on. If an item from a daily journal is pending external action and not resolved at the end of the day, it is good to move here. 

## Weekly recurring
Recurring tasks you *must do* on a certain day go here. Consider replacing with a recurring invite calendar if that's more your style, though it's a nice feeling to be able to check things off during the week.
