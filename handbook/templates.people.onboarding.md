## Welcome to Dendron!

We are so excited you’re here and look forward to setting you up for remote-first success as your journey begins. You can work through the tasks over the course of your first 30 days. If any task doesn't make sense, please reach out to the team on discord in `#dendron-team`. 

- **Note:** We're really appreciative of Gitlab pioneering the space of remote work and have included a lot of links to the Gitlab handbook. The wealth of information in this note can be overwhelming at times. It's okay to skim through resources, bookmark them and come back at a later time.

## Introduction

This is your core onboarding to work at Dendron. It has been crafted with the [three dimensions of remote onboarding](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/onboarding/) in mind, namely: Organizational Onboarding, Technical Onboarding and Social Onboarding.

## Support and our Single Source of Truth

Since Dendron aspires to be a [handbook first](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/) organization, the answer to question you may have particularly throughout your first thirty days should be documented and readily available in the [handbook](http://handbook.dendron.so). If you are unable to find the information you are looking for, please reach out on the `#dendron-team` channel in Discord and update the handbook once you find the answer.

## The First Thirty Days

This note consists of a series of tasks which should be completed sequentially over the course of the next thirty days structured as follows:

| Day        | Area of Focus                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Day 01** | Intro, Accounts, Paperwork, First Task       |
| **Day 02** | Remote Work: Communication and Values        |
| **Day 03** | Organizational Structure and Social Elements |
| **Day 04** | Introduction to Dendron and using Github     |


Though you may be eager to jump right into your role we encourage you to set aside dedicated time every day for your first week to focus on these tasks as they are geared toward ensuring you are enabled to [thrive in an all-remote environment](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/onboarding/#the-importance-of-onboarding).

## Continuous Improvement

In the interests of [[passing it forward|dendron://dendron.handbook/handbook.company.values#pass-it-forward]], we encourage you to suggest changes and updates to this note and the handbook, both of which can be done via Pull Request (PR).

Along with this you will complete onboarding on Day Thirty by being asked to fill out the [Onboarding Satisfaction Survey](https://airtable.com/shrcILcL6cm6lpCZt), which is an opportunity to share feedback on your general Onboarding Experience.

## Day 1 - Getting Started: Accounts and Paperwork

- NOTE1: the best way to follow along in this onboarding is by using the preview. You can run `Dendron: Show Preview` by selecting it from the [command prompt](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/rLlUBUvNmv5gu9YmZfUJE.html).
- NOTE2: relative links currently don't work in the preview (this is currently being addressed). To navigate links, hover over a link in the editor and use `CTRL+Enter` to navigate

#### Daily Journal Note

This is how we do standups at Dendron

- [ ] Read over the sop[^sop] on [[handbook.sop.daily-journal]]
- [ ] Open your daily journal note for today. It should be in the format of `user.{{ALIAS}}.{{date}}`. Your manager should have created this one for you. You're responsible for maintaining your own journals for future dates. You can read more about the format [[here|schemas.user#dailyjournal]] 
   - NOTE: to create a daily journal, we recommend [[pinning|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.guides.tips#pinning-tabs]] your current daily journal and then using lookup to update the day component at the end of the day to create the daily journal for the next day

![[Hourly|templates.people.onboarding.hourly]]

#### 2FA 

Dendron requires you to enable 2FA[^2fa]

This absolutely must be done within a week or you will be locked out and need to wait for an admin to get around to helping you get reconnected.

- [ ]  Enable [two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/configuring-two-factor-authentication) on your Github account.

<!-- full timers only --->
- [ ]  Enable 2FA on your Dendron email account (Gmail/GSuite) (this should have been an option to do when you first received the invitation to the account).

#### Rippling

Rippling is our HRIS (Human Resource Information System) for all team members. This section is super important to ensure payroll + operations support

- [ ] Access the Rippling [Dashboard](https://app.rippling.com) and make sure you complete any outstanding tasks assigned to you.
- [ ] For contractors being paid by the hour, it may be useful to save an invoice template for future use. An invoice template can be found in Google Docs by searching `Invoice Template` or [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1faslC4H_NSLsk8jd8xUuwgAjqhkdSlaI0D1WINA1y9Y/edit#gid=0).
- [ ] Don't forget to comply with the contract you signed, and make sure you understand [Intellectual Property](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/code-of-conduct/#intellectual-property-and-protecting-ip).

#### User Intro
- [ ] Create and add your own [[user readme|templates.user-readme]]. This goes in `user.{{ALIAS}}` 
   - NOTE: this may take some time to create so please feel free to iterate on it over the course of the week

#### Discord

- [ ] Register on Discord by following this [invitation link](https://discord.gg/xrKTUStHNZ). Read the next suggestions on how to choose a username first.
   - [ ] You can use your personal discord OR choose to create a new username using your Dendron email. It's generally helpful to choose a username to be the same as your Github handle, for consistency and ease of use.
- [ ] Make sure your Discord profile has a **photo** - it makes it easier for other team members to remember you!
- [ ] If you're new to Discord, a short primer can be found at [a Beginner's guide to Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord).
- [ ] Make sure you have access to the `#dendron-team` channel and post an intro.
   1. This can be the [[About me|templates.user-readme#about-me]] that you used for your README
   1. We love to hear more, such as where you were before, family/pets, and hobbies.
   1. We also enjoy pictures if you're willing to share. Consider giving your new team members a glimpse into your world (scroll through previous messages in the channel for inspiration).

#### Rpass
<!-- Full time only -->
- [ ] Install rpass. Dendron provides all team members with an account to rpass to help manage work credentials.

#### Other
- [ ] Accept calendar invite to the Dendron Company Calendar

#### Initial Tasks

- [ ] Go to [[Job-specific tasks|templates.people.onboarding#job-specific-tasks]] for role specific tasks
- [ ] Go to your [[weekly journal|handbook.sop.weekly-journal]] at `user.{username}.weekly.{date}` to see your specific tasks

If at any point you find yourself stuck, don't hesitate to leave a question in the `#dendron-team` channel.

Calendly is a calendar tool that allows individuals to select open meeting slots in order to speak with others outside of Dendron. For Dendron team members, feel free to schedule directly through Google calendar. When you are setting up Calendly, there is no specific Dendron account. With the free version you will only be allowed one meeting time, but if you need to upgrade to a Pro account, you can do so and expense it.

Click on `What event is this?` and under `Location` choose Zoom. Click on `Save and Close`, and do this for each remaining event type.
