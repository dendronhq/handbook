## Summary

This is the meta SOP (Standard Operating Procedures) for SOP.

## Process

### Creating a new SOP
When a SOP is first created, make sure to send a pull request to the right audience (eg. usually either the team or the community at large). If a SOP is sent to the team, everyone should be listed as a reviewer. The SOP needs to have everyone approving it before it can be merged

Do not just blindly accept the SOP. When you approve the SOP, it means that you have read it, understand the action items, and agree to implement them moving forward.

### Updating an existing SOP

Same instructions as [[Creating a new SOP|handbook.sop.sop#creating-a-new-sop]]

### Executing a SOP

When executing a SOP, if that SOP has a `## Checklist`, be sure to copy that checklist into the task tracking the execution of said SOP
