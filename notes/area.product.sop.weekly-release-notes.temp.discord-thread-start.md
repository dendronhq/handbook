## Start of Thread

```markdown
@DendronTeam 
It's that time of week again! In about ~12 hours, we'll be creating the changelog for the weekly release.

Review [[Ready to Ship|weekly.journal.2022.03.15#ready-to-ship]] for updates:
- Make sure community contributions are logged (in [[weekly.journal.2022.03.15.contributions]])
- Make sure your contributions are included in the Ready to Ship section
- If a change is not shipping in this release, move it to the next weekly journal's ready-to-ship section so that it is excluded from the changelog and release notes
- Make sure any docs updates are in and linked to where applicable (generally means Features and Enhancements should have a docs link, or reviewed/updated docs when appropriate)
```
