Hey {{fm.name}},

Writing to let you know that you've been nominated by one of our members as a speaker for the [[Dendron Greenhouse|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community.events.greenhouse]], a talk series focused on all things knowledge management. 

<!-- PERSONALIZED STATEMENT -->

If you're interested, the format is a talk that is 10min-30min long, with the structure being up to your discretion (eg. demo, talk, interpretive dance, etc).

Example of a past talk [[here|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/community.events.greenhouse.2022-02-25-gtd-bullet-journals-task-management-workflow-demos]].

Let me know what you think - the series runs all year long and is given on the last Friday of each month.  Happy to send more details if interested.

Cheers,
{{fm.signature}}
