## Summary
The weekly journal is how we track tasks and priorities for individuals. It is also a good place to store tasks that are currently blocked or in the future.

Weekly journals are recorded in `user.{name}.weekly.*`

## Steps
1. Every monday, create a new weekly journal entry `user.{name}.weekly.{date}`
    - for Dendron, we start the week on Tuesday so have your `date` be the tuesday of the following week
    - eg. for user `bob` starting the process on `2021-09-06`, the next week entry would be `user.bob.journal.2021.09.14`, 
1. This will apply the [[Weekly Journal Template|dendron://dendron.handbook/templates.weekly-journal]] to your note
