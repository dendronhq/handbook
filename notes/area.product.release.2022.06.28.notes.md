**Depth Filter for Local Graphs:** Want to see the bigger picture? The graph depth filter now lets you control how much context you see in the [[Local Graph View|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.sidebar.local-graph-view]]

**Improved Note Traits:** Rust isn't the only language with traits! We've made a bunch of improvements to traits, including hot reloading, the ability to apply a template, bundling libraries like lodash and luxon, as well as better docs and error handling.
