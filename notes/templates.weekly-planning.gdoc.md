## Wins
<!-- Wins cover items that show Dendron gaining traction. This could be positive user messages in Discord, instances of Dendron spotted in the wild, or cool new use cases. Wins can also include internal changes that reduced overhead or made existing processes easier to do. Wins should not be a list of features that were just shipped, this should be covered in the [[Goals|dendron.sop.weekly-planning#goals]] section.

Example:
```markdown
- testimonial -> @SpiderBug (discord): I've been using note references every day to track my monthly goals in my daily journals and absolutely love it
- user made a new tutorial for dendron -> https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-personal-knowledge-management-system-with-dendron-b24b
- adding husky hook reduced all occurences of `.only` in codebase
``` -->
