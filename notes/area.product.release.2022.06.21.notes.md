@everyone

Dendron 0.100 has sprouted  üå±
https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/14h74cnp9no9joxavmo7gr6/

**v100:** Today marks 100 releases of Dendron! Two years ago, we launched Dendron because we believed there was a better way of managing knowledge. Over six hundred feature releases later, we think we're 3% of the way there üòÖ!

To celebrate the v100 milestone, we're also launching on product hunt today! If Dendron has been of use to you, please leave feedback on our [product hunt page](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/dendron-v100) today (product hunt is heavily skewed for launch day feedback) - this would help us out a lot! üôè

**Recent Workspaces Panel:** Navigating through multiple workspaces has never been easier! This new panel will show you your last 5 opened Dendron workspaces and you can access them with just a click.
- More information: [[Recent Workspaces|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.sidebar.recent-workspaces]]
